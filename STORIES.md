## My First Pull Request
by @octocat

I remember my first pull request like it was yesterday. It was a small documentation fix, 
but the maintainer was so welcoming and helpful. That experience taught me that every 
contribution matters, no matter how small.

## From User to Maintainer
by @githubber

Started using GitHub for college projects in 2015. Now I maintain several open source 
projects with thousands of stars. The journey has been incredible, and I've learned so 
much from the community.
